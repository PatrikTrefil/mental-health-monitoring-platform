# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern
static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

The documentation includes TSDoc generated documentation for the web
application. The generation of the documentation required the
`/src/web-app/next-env.d.ts`, which can be generated by building the web
application (this step must be done manually).

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.
